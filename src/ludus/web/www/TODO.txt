ToDo:
- consolidate background layer into single image
- sprites not used in background but used in other layers become named sprites in crafty (loaded in scenes.js) 

- group tool that consolidates sprite in group into one object and one image?

- change image loading to sprite sheet object so sheets load only once
- add user icon broadcast changes

- move game state changes from js layer to server
- implement locks on key areas of game state

- if locking objects on selected, must resolve layers deleting cascade
- must also resolve point deletes from sprite list view and erase tool

Done:
- prevent loss of active sprite on update /
- get click through map grid working /
- move duplicate overlap function to utils /
- generate true unique default obj name /
